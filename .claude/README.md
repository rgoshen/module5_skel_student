## üéØ When to Use Which Documentation

### For Project Status Questions ‚≠ê
**Use PROJECT_STATUS.md** when you need:
- Current implementation progress
- What tasks are completed vs. pending
- Next priority work items
- Requirement mapping and dependencies

```bash
# Examples:
"What still needs to be implemented?"                    # ‚Üí PROJECT_STATUS.md
"What should I work on next?"                           # ‚Üí PROJECT_STATUS.md  
"Has the HTML formatting been completed?"               # ‚Üí PROJECT_STATUS.md
"What are the current priorities?"                      # ‚Üí PROJECT_STATUS.md
```

### For Strategic Questions
**Use Kiro Steering docs** when you need:
- Business context and project goals
- High-level architectural decisions
- Technology selection rationale
- Project evolution strategy

### For Implementation Questions
**Use Claude development docs** when you need:
- Specific code examples and patterns
- Detailed debugging procedures
- Security implementation guidance
- Step-by-step development workflows

### For Daily Development
**Use root CLAUDE.md** when you need:
- Quick command reference
- Immediate troubleshooting
- Essential URLs and endpoints

## üîÑ Documentation Workflow for Claude Code

### 1. Always Start with Project Status
```bash
1. Check PROJECT_STATUS.md for current progress
2. Identify which tasks are incomplete
3. Reference detailed implementation docs as needed
4. Update PROJECT_STATUS.md when tasks completed
```

### 2. Development Decision Flow
```
Need to work on project ‚Üí Check PROJECT_STATUS.md ‚Üí Find priority tasks
    ‚Üì
Need implementation details ‚Üí Check ARCHITECTURE.md or SECURITY.md
    ‚Üì
Need setup/debugging help ‚Üí Check DEVELOPMENT.md
    ‚Üì
Need quick command ‚Üí Check ../CLAUDE.md
```

### 3. Task Completion Workflow
```
Complete task ‚Üí Update PROJECT_STATUS.md ‚Üí Mark task as [x]
    ‚Üì
Move to "Completed Tasks" section ‚Üí Update progress metrics
    ‚Üì
Commit documentation changes ‚Üí Continue with next priority
```

**üí° Tip**: PROJECT_STATUS.md is the "living document" that changes as work progresses. All other docs are more stable references for how to implement things correctly.
