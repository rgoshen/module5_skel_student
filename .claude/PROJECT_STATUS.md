## 🚀 Next Steps for Claude Code

### When Working on This Project:

1. **Check this file first** to understand current implementation status
2. **Focus on incomplete tasks** marked with [ ]
3. **Prioritize tasks marked with ⚠️ PRIORITY**
4. **Reference requirements mapping** to understand why each task is needed
5. **Update this file** when tasks are completed

### Task Selection Guidelines:

```bash
# For immediate development work
→ Focus on Tasks 7-8 (HTML formatting, error handling)

# For testing and validation
→ Focus on Tasks 9-10 (SSL config, student integration)

# For final polishing
→ Focus on Tasks 11-14 (monitoring, optimization, documentation)
```

### Dependencies to Consider:
- Task 7 (HTML formatting) → needed for browser testing
- Task 8 (error handling) → needed for secure production deployment
- Task 9 (SSL config) → needed for HTTPS-only requirement
- Task 10 (student integration) → needed for assignment compliance

**💡 Pro Tip**: When Claude Code helps with implementation, reference this file to understand what's already built and what still needs work. This prevents rebuilding existing functionality and ensures focus on remaining requirements.

**🔄 Update Instructions**: Mark tasks as [x] when completed and move them to the "Completed Tasks" section. Add new tasks if requirements evolve.
