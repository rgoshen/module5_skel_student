# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a secure checksum verification system using cryptographic hash functions. The system addresses the business need for secure public key distribution by providing integrity verification capabilities that detect tampering and malicious file substitution attacks. This implementation serves both educational objectives for CS305 Module Five assignment and demonstrates real-world cryptographic security practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business distributing public keys to clients, I want to provide checksum verification for downloaded public keys, so that clients can verify file integrity and detect tampering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a business needs to distribute a public key THEN the system SHALL provide a secure checksum generation mechanism
2. WHEN the checksum is generated THEN the system SHALL use a collision-resistant cryptographic hash algorithm
3. WHEN clients download the public key THEN the system SHALL provide both the file and its corresponding checksum

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a CS305 student, I want to implement a working checksum verification system, so that I can demonstrate understanding of cryptographic hash functions and secure coding practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the hash function THEN the system SHALL use the java.security.MessageDigest library
2. WHEN generating a checksum THEN the system SHALL include the student's first and last name in the data string
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL display the original data, algorithm name, and generated hash value
4. WHEN accessed via web browser THEN the system SHALL serve content over HTTPS on port 8443

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want to select an appropriate cryptographic hash algorithm, so that the system is resistant to collision attacks and meets current security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting a hash algorithm THEN the system SHALL use algorithms from Oracle's Java Security Standard Algorithm Names
2. WHEN evaluating algorithms THEN the system SHALL prioritize collision resistance over performance
3. WHEN implementing the algorithm THEN the system SHALL avoid deprecated algorithms (MD5, SHA-1)
4. WHEN documenting the choice THEN the system SHALL provide technical justification for the selected algorithm

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to access checksum verification via a RESTful endpoint, so that I can integrate checksum verification into automated workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the /hash endpoint THEN the system SHALL respond with HTML containing verification data
2. WHEN the endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return the original data string
3. WHEN the endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return the algorithm name used
4. WHEN the endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return the hexadecimal representation of the hash
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle cryptographic exceptions gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want all communications to be encrypted, so that data integrity is maintained during transmission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL only accept HTTPS connections
2. WHEN configuring SSL THEN the system SHALL use the provided PKCS12 keystore
3. WHEN clients connect THEN the system SHALL serve content exclusively on port 8443
4. WHEN SSL errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a CS305 instructor, I want to evaluate student understanding of cryptographic concepts, so that I can assess learning objectives and provide appropriate feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting the assignment THEN the system SHALL include refactored source code
2. WHEN documenting the implementation THEN the system SHALL include algorithm justification
3. WHEN demonstrating functionality THEN the system SHALL include a browser screenshot showing the working application
4. WHEN citing sources THEN the system SHALL follow APA format guidelines

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want clean, well-documented code, so that the system is maintainable and follows professional standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing methods THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive Javadoc documentation
2. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions and formatting
3. WHEN creating classes THEN the system SHALL implement single responsibility principle
4. WHEN handling complex logic THEN the system SHALL include inline comments explaining business logic

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want the system to follow security best practices, so that it is resistant to common attacks and vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive information in error messages or stack traces
2. WHEN validating input THEN the system SHALL implement comprehensive input sanitization and validation
3. WHEN logging information THEN the system SHALL not log sensitive data or cryptographic keys
4. WHEN handling exceptions THEN the system SHALL implement secure error handling patterns
