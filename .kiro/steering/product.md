# Product Overview

## Business Context and Purpose

This is a **CS-305 Module Five Checksum Verification Project** that demonstrates real-world cryptographic security implementation through a business scenario where organizations must securely distribute public keys to clients.

### Core Business Problem
- Organizations need to distribute public keys and sensitive files to clients
- Downloaded files can be tampered with during transmission
- Clients need a reliable way to verify file integrity
- Attackers may substitute malicious files with identical names

### Solution Approach
A secure checksum verification system that generates cryptographically secure hash values, enabling clients to verify file integrity and detect tampering attempts.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Security-conscious businesses** distributing cryptographic keys and sensitive documents
- **Clients downloading public keys** who need integrity verification
- **CS-305 students** learning practical cryptographic implementation

### User Goals
- **Businesses**: Provide trustworthy file distribution with integrity guarantees
- **Clients**: Verify downloaded files haven't been tampered with
- **Students**: Demonstrate understanding of cryptographic hash functions and secure coding

## Key Features and Value Propositions

### Core Security Features
- **Collision-Resistant Hashing**: Uses modern algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-3-256) that make forgery computationally infeasible
- **Algorithm Validation**: Automatically rejects deprecated/compromised algorithms (MD5, SHA-1)
- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive validation prevents injection attacks
- **Secure Error Handling**: No sensitive information exposed in error messages

### Technical Capabilities
- **RESTful API**: Clean `/hash` endpoint for programmatic access
- **SSL/TLS Encryption**: All communications secured with HTTPS on port 8443
- **PKCS12 Integration**: Industry-standard certificate management
- **Real-time Verification**: Immediate hash generation and display

### Educational Value
- **Industry-Standard Practices**: Implements patterns used in production systems
- **Security-First Design**: Demonstrates defense-in-depth principles
- **Professional Architecture**: SOLID principles and clean code practices
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Enterprise-level code documentation

## Business Requirements and Constraints

### Security Requirements
- **Must** use collision-resistant hash algorithms only
- **Must** prevent information leakage through error messages
- **Must** validate all inputs for security compliance
- **Must** maintain audit trail without exposing sensitive data

### Technical Constraints
- **Java 8+** with Spring Boot framework (educational environment)
- **Oracle Java Security Standard algorithms** only (platform compliance)
- **Self-signed certificates** acceptable for educational use

### Academic Constraints
- **Individual implementation** required (academic integrity)
- **Personal data integration** (student name in hash input)
- **Screenshot evidence** required for verification
- **APA citation standards** for all sources

## Why This Architecture Matters

### Security-First Design Philosophy
The architecture prioritizes security at every layer, demonstrating that security cannot be "bolted on" but must be designed in from the foundation. This approach reflects real-world enterprise security practices.

### Educational Value Beyond Assignment
While meeting CS-305 requirements, the implementation teaches patterns and practices directly applicable to professional software development, making the learning investment valuable beyond academic assessment.

### Real-World Relevance
The business scenario mirrors actual challenges in software distribution, certificate management, and data integrity verification that security professionals encounter daily in enterprise environments.
